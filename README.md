# My Personal Project

## Java Customer Tracker

**1.**  For my term project my idea is to design a system that can track customers and their previous
   purchases or activity. In many businesses the ability to track what a customer has bought and different
   information about a particular customer.

**2.**  My targeted group of people that would use this item are mechanic shops. This program will allow mechanic
   shops to track their customer through several different methods, such as the type of car, name, phone number,
   or email. In addition, these customers can be stored and accessed whenever needed and with it, the make, and model of
   their car and as an extra feature this program will be able to store information on special parts that must be
   ordered.

**3.**  I decided on this idea because my dad is a co-owner of a mechanic shop and uses a program similar to my idea.
   Since I am still a new programmer I drew inspiration from a simpler program however the idea that with a few changes
   it can be used for a different type of shop is very interesting to me.
